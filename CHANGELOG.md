# Changelog

## 1.0.2
- Fixed: removed `throw error` from `handleErrorWithReturn` — was causing double error emission in StreamBuilder
- Fixed: added `return false` to satisfy non-nullable return type
- Removed: `get` package dependency — `.tr` was unused (no translation map provided)
- Improved: `const Failure` for better memory efficiency

## 1.0.1
